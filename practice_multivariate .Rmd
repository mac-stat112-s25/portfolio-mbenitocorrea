## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

# Check out the first 6 rows
head(weather)
# What are the units of observation?
#dates

# How many data points do we have? 
nrow(weather)
#2367

# What type of variables do we have?
#categorical and quant
```
Example 1
Construct a plot that allows us to examine how temp3pm varies.
```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm)) +
  geom_density()  +
  theme_minimal()
```

Example 2
Construct 3 plots that address the following research question:

How do afternoon temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?
```{r}
# Plot 1 (no facets & starting from a density plot of temp3pm)
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density()
```
```{r}
# Plot 2 (no facets or densities)
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# Plot 3 (facets)
# facet_wrap separates the density plots into "facets" for each historical group
# What does facet_wrap do?!
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~ location)

ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) +
  geom_bar()  +
  facet_wrap(~ location)

```
```{r}
# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)
woll <- weather |>
  filter(location == "Wollongong") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  
```

```{r}

```
